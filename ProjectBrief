# StrengthQuest - Project Brief

## Executive Summary

**StrengthQuest** is a gamified strength training tracker that uses RPG/MMO leveling mechanics to motivate weightlifters. The core thesis: there's significant overlap between MMO grinders (particularly old-school Runescape players) and serious weightlifters - both appreciate granular progression systems, "number go up" satisfaction, and the meditative nature of consistent grinding toward long-term goals.

**Target Audience:** Gamers (especially MMO players) who are already lifting weights, NOT aspirational fitness beginners.

**Key Differentiator:** This is NOT a general fitness app. This is specifically for strength training with the big 3 lifts (Bench, Squat, Deadlift), with RPG-style progression systems that mirror old-school MMO mechanics.

---

## Product Positioning

### Name Decision: StrengthQuest (NOT FitQuest)

**Why StrengthQuest:**
- Focus beats breadth for early-stage products
- Strength training has clear, objective progression metrics
- The entire leveling system is built for progressive overload
- "StrengthQuest - RPG progression for lifters" = clear, differentiated, memeable
- Can always expand to other fitness modalities later after dominating the niche

**Why NOT FitQuest:**
- "Fitness" is too broad and dilutes everything
- Competes with Strava, Peloton, etc.
- Cardio/yoga/HIIT have different psychology than the "grind" mentality
- Makes the tier system incoherent across different modalities

---

## Core Game Mechanics (v0.1 Implementation)

### Character System

**Six Character Classes:**
- Deadlift Knight
- Bench Berserker
- Bicep Bandit
- Quad King
- Grip Gladiator
- Iron Titan

**Character Attributes:**
- Name (user-chosen)
- Class (selected at creation)
- Gender (affects tier thresholds)
- Bodyweight in lbs (used for tier calculations)
- Character Level = Average of three skill levels (rounded down)

### Three Core Skills

Each skill tracks a primary lift plus supporting exercises:

| Skill | Primary Exercise | Color | Supporting Exercises |
|-------|-----------------|-------|---------------------|
| Push | Bench Press | Red | Incline Bench, Overhead Press, etc. |
| Pull | Deadlift | Blue | Barbell Row, Pull-ups, etc. |
| Legs | Squat | Green | Front Squat, Leg Press, etc. |

**Important:** Only the primary exercises (Bench/Deadlift/Squat) contribute to tier calculations and Total Strength.

### XP and Leveling System

**XP Formula:**
```
Base XP = (Intensity × 5) + (Length in minutes ÷ 5)
PR Bonus = +50 XP (awarded when new PR is achieved)
```

**Intensity:** 1-10 scale (user-selected per workout)
**Length:** 5-120 minutes (user-selected per workout)

**Level Thresholds:**

| Level | XP Required | Total XP |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 50 | 50 |
| 3 | 75 | 125 |
| 4 | 100 | 225 |
| 5 | 125 | 350 |
| 6 | 150 | 500 |
| 7 | 175 | 675 |
| 8 | 200 | 875 |
| 9 | 225 | 1100 |
| 10 | 250 | 1350 |

**Note on Level Progression:** Current progression may be too fast early game. Consider extending to level 50/100 or using exponential scaling to make milestones more meaningful (more similar to Runescape's long-term progression).

### PR and 1RM System

**Estimated 1RM Formula:**
```
1RM = Weight × (1 + (Reps / 30))
```

**Key Rules:**
- Rep cap at 10 for calculation purposes (if reps > 10, uses 10 and notifies user)
- PR determination based on calculated 1RM, not raw weight (allows PRs through increased reps)
- Bodyweight exercises supported (0 lbs allowed for pull-ups, dips, etc.)
- Top set identification: automatically identifies highest calculated 1RM set in each workout
- Motivational messages for non-PR workouts showing comparison to current PR

### Tier System

Tiers based on bodyweight multiplier of 1RM. The tier names include Runescape references (Mithril, Dragon) which immediately signals to target audience.

**Male Tier Thresholds:**

| Tier | Squat | Bench | Deadlift |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| Bronze | < 1.0× | < 0.75× | < 1.0× |
| Iron | 1.0 – 1.25× | 0.75 – 1.0× | 1.0 – 1.5× |
| Silver | 1.25 – 1.5× | 1.0 – 1.25× | 1.5 – 1.75× |
| Gold | 1.5 – 1.75× | 1.25 – 1.5× | 1.75 – 2.25× |
| Mithril | 1.75 – 2.5× | 1.5 – 2.0× | 2.25 – 3.0× |
| Dragon | 2.5 – 2.75× | 2.0 – 2.25× | 3.0 – 3.25× |
| Diamond | 2.75 – 3.0× | 2.25 – 2.5× | 3.25 – 3.5× |
| Greek God | > 3.0× | > 2.5× | > 3.5× |

**Female Tier Thresholds:**

| Tier | Squat | Bench | Deadlift |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| Bronze | < 0.75× | < 0.5× | < 1.0× |
| Iron | 0.75 – 1.0× | 0.5 – 0.6× | 1.0 – 1.25× |
| Silver | 1.0 – 1.25× | 0.6 – 0.75× | 1.25 – 1.5× |
| Gold | 1.25 – 1.5× | 0.75 – 1.0× | 1.5 – 1.75× |
| Mithril | 1.5 – 2.0× | 1.0 – 1.1× | 1.75 – 2.25× |
| Dragon | 2.0 – 2.25× | 1.1 – 1.25× | 2.25 – 3.0× |
| Diamond | 2.25 – 2.5× | 1.25 – 1.35× | 3.0 – 3.25× |
| Greek God | > 2.25× | > 1.25× | > 3.0× |

### Total Strength

**Definition:** Sum of all three primary lift 1RMs (Bench + Deadlift + Squat)

**Features:**
- Has its own bodyweight multiplier
- Has its own tier system (using same tier names)
- Displayed prominently on dashboard
- Functions as meta-stat / endgame metric

---

## Current State (v0.1 Prototype)

**What Exists:**
- Built in V0 (web-based visual builder)
- Works locally only
- No database (data not persisted)
- No authentication/login system
- Basic UI functional but aesthetically plain
- All core game mechanics implemented and working

**What's Missing:**
- Database persistence
- User authentication
- Deployment to live URL
- More game-like visual design
- Social features
- Analytics/tracking

---

## Technical Migration Plan

### Current State
- V0 prototype works locally
- No database persistence
- No authentication
- Need to move to production-ready setup

### Key Technical Decisions to Make

These decisions should be made collaboratively during development based on what makes sense as you build:

**Database & Backend:**
- Options to explore: Supabase, Convex, Firebase, or other solutions
- Need to support: user data, workout history, character progression
- Consider: ease of setup, free tier limits, real-time capabilities, authentication integration

**Authentication:**
- Start simple (email/password likely sufficient)
- Can add OAuth providers later if needed
- Should integrate cleanly with chosen database solution

**Deployment:**
- Need a live URL for testing and launch
- Free tier important for MVP
- Easy deployment process preferred

**Tech Stack:**
- V0 likely generated React/Next.js code
- Port to local development environment
- Maintain feature parity with prototype first

### What Needs to Be Built

**Core Infrastructure:**
1. Database schema to persist all game data
2. Authentication system for user accounts  
3. API layer (or serverless functions) to handle game logic
4. Deployment pipeline to get it live

**Data Model Requirements:**
At minimum, need to track:
- Users and their characters (name, class, gender, bodyweight)
- Skills and progression (XP, levels for Push/Pull/Legs)
- Workouts (date, intensity, length, XP gained)
- Exercises and sets (weight, reps, RPE, calculated 1RM)
- Personal records and tier progression
- Historical data for calendar/streak tracking

**Specific schema design should be hashed out during implementation.**

### Development Approach

**Philosophy:**
- Start with simplest solution that works
- Avoid over-engineering
- Choose boring, proven technology
- Optimize for speed of iteration, not perfection

**Priorities:**
1. Get it working end-to-end (even if rough)
2. Make it look game-like
3. Deploy to production URL
4. Test with real users
5. Iterate based on feedback

Technical implementation details should emerge from actual building, not upfront planning.

## Design Philosophy and Improvements Needed

### Current State: Too Plain

The v0.1 UI is functional but lacks the visual appeal necessary for a **gamified** application. For an app targeting gamers, aesthetic is part of the core value proposition.

### What "Game-ified" Means Visually

**Visual Hierarchy That Screams RPG:**
- Character portrait more prominent (even if just icon/silhouette)
- Skill cards should look like actual cards (think Hearthstone/MTG aesthetic)
- Level ups need satisfying visual feedback
- Tier badges should look like achievements/medals

**Color and Depth:**
- Current design is flat and gray
- RPG UIs have depth, borders, slight gradients
- Lean harder into skill colors (red Push, blue Pull, green Legs)
- Add texture, shadows, borders

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- "Level 1 Deadlift Knight" should feel EPIC
- Numbers (700 lbs, 3.78x BW) should pop
- Progress bars should be chunkier, more game-like

**Animation and Feedback:**
- Level up animations
- PR achievement celebrations
- Smooth transitions
- Satisfying micro-interactions

### Design Inspiration Sources
- Habitica (gamified habit tracker)
- Duolingo (achievement system, streaks)
- Old Runescape UI (skill cards, level up notifications)
- WoW character sheets (stat displays)
- Hearthstone/MTG (card aesthetics)

### Time-Boxed Redesign Approach

**Day 1:** Gather inspiration
- Screenshot 5-10 UI examples from above sources
- Identify specific elements to incorporate

**Day 2:** Rebuild core screens
- Dashboard
- Skills page
- Workout logging flow
- Focus on screens users see most

**Day 3:** Polish and test
- Fix bugs
- Ensure responsiveness
- Test on mobile

**Then ship.** Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

---

## Features to Add Soon (Post-Launch)

### Quick Wins

**Milestone Celebrations:**
- First time hitting new tier = full-screen animation
- "Achievement Unlocked" style notifications
- Shareable graphics for social media

**Estimated Time to Next Tier:**
- "Based on your progress, you'll hit Gold in Bench in ~8 weeks"
- Provides motivation and clear goals

**Exercise Variety Incentives:**
- Achievement badges for accessory work
- "Completed 50 total sets of Bicep Curls - unlocked 'Arm Day Enthusiast' badge"
- Doesn't affect tiers but provides additional engagement

**Weekly Summary Push Notification:**
- "You trained 4 times this week and gained 2 levels in Push!"
- Critical for retention

### Social Features (Later)

**Leaderboards:**
- By Total Strength
- By individual lift tiers
- By character class

**Friend System:**
- Add gym buddies
- Compare progress
- Friendly competition

**Guild/Clan System:**
- Team-based challenges
- Shared goals
- Community building

---

## Monetization Strategy

### Phase 1: Free to Build Audience (Weeks 1-4)
- Launch completely free
- Focus on getting 100+ active users
- Measure 7-day and 30-day retention
- Learn what features drive engagement

### Phase 2: Introduce Premium (After Validation)

**Metrics to Hit Before Monetizing:**
- 100+ active users logging workouts weekly
- 30-day retention >40%
- Clear feature requests that justify paid tier

**Freemium Model (Recommended):**

**Free Tier:**
- Basic tracking for the big 3 lifts
- Character creation and leveling
- History/calendar view
- Single user experience

**Premium ($10/month):**
- Unlimited exercises (not just big 3)
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- Cosmetic unlocks (character customization)
- Leaderboards and social features
- Custom workout programs
- Export data
- No ads (if free tier has them)

**Alternative: Lifetime Deal**
- Offer early adopters lifetime access ($99-199)
- Creates immediate cash flow
- Builds loyal core user base
- Can grandfather these users when switching to subscription

**Note:** Classic MMO freemium model works well here - free to play, pay for cosmetics and advanced features.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Week 1: Initial Launch

**Target Platforms:**
1. **r/weightroom** - "I built a Runescape-style tracker for the big 3 lifts"
2. **r/powerlifting** - Serious lifters who track everything
3. **r/bodybuilding** - Aesthetic-focused but appreciate progression
4. **Gaming fitness Discord servers** - Direct crossover audience
5. **Bodybuilding forums** - Old school crowd that remembers Runescape

**Launch Post Template:**
- Lead with a screenshot of YOUR character hitting a new tier
- "After 6 weeks of tracking, my Deadlift Knight just hit Gold tier"
- Be transparent it's v0.1
- Explicitly ask for feedback
- Make signup dead simple (<30 seconds)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Onboarding must be friction-free
- First workout log must take <2 minutes
- App must not crash
- Core loop (log workout → see level up) must feel satisfying

### Week 2: Iterate Based on Feedback

**Watch For:**
- What breaks most often
- What features people immediately ask for vs. actually use
- Where people drop off in the flow
- Retention metrics (7-day, 14-day, 30-day)

**Talk To Power Users:**
- Anyone who uses it 3+ times = power user
- Their behavior > everyone's opinions
- Ask what would make them pay for it

### Distribution Channels to Explore Later
- Fitness YouTubers who game
- Twitch streamers who lift
- Gaming conventions with fitness areas
- Powerlifting meet sponsorships
- College strength & conditioning programs

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Activation Metrics
- Signup to first workout logged (target: >60%)
- Time to first workout logged (target: <5 minutes)
- Completion rate of first workout log (target: >80%)

### Engagement Metrics
- Workouts logged per week (target: 3-4 for active users)
- 7-day retention (target: >50%)
- 30-day retention (target: >40%)
- 90-day retention (target: >30%)

### Progression Metrics
- Average time to first level up
- Average time to first tier upgrade
- Distribution of user levels/tiers
- PR frequency

### Social Proof Metrics
- Screenshots shared
- Reddit post upvotes/engagement
- Referrals from existing users

---

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risk: Niche Too Small
**Validation:** Need to prove 5,000+ potential users exist (at $10/mo = $600k ARR)
**Mitigation:** Early launch will reveal market size quickly. If too small, can expand to "FitQuest" with other modalities

### Risk: Gamers Talk About Fitness More Than They Do It
**Validation:** Track ratio of signups to active users (>30% = good signal)
**Mitigation:** Focus marketing on people ALREADY lifting AND gaming, not aspirational

### Risk: Retention Drops After 90 Days
**Validation:** Standard fitness app problem, but "grind mentality" might help
**Mitigation:** Design for long-term goals (maxing a skill takes months), add endgame content (leaderboards, achievements)

### Risk: Competitors Copy the Idea
**Mitigation:** 
- Move fast and own the niche before big players notice
- Build community and network effects
- Your unfair advantage is being the user - you understand both worlds intimately

### Risk: Over-Engineering Before Validation
**Mitigation:**
- Time-box all development work
- Ship embarrassingly minimal versions
- Only build what's needed for core loop
- Kill features that don't drive retention

---

## Success Criteria (6-Month Milestones)

### Month 1: Validation
- 100+ signups
- 50+ active users (logging workouts weekly)
- 30-day retention >30%
- Core loop validated (people come back)

### Month 3: Growth
- 500+ active users
- 30-day retention >40%
- Clear understanding of premium features users want
- Profitable unit economics (if monetizing)

### Month 6: Scale
- 2,000+ active users
- 30-day retention >45%
- $10k+ MRR (if monetized)
- Community forming organically
- Clear roadmap for next features

**Focus:**
- Build most-requested features
- Optimize retention drop-off points
- Add social features if requested
- Consider monetization if metrics hit targets

**Success Metric:** 30-day retention >40%, clear path to monetization

---

## Unfair Advantages

1. **You are the target user** - Deep understanding of both MMO grinding psychology and weightlifting progression
2. **Clear niche thesis** - Specific and testable, not vague
3. **Fast iteration capability** - Can ship features in days with modern tools
4. **Timing** - Vibe coding makes solo development viable, gamification in fitness still unsolved for this niche

---

## Things NOT to Build (Feature Creep Prevention)

### Don't Build Until Users Ask:
- AI coaching/recommendations
- Nutrition tracking
- Cardio/conditioning tracking
- Video form checks
- Workout program templates
- Integration with other apps
- Hardware (smart watches, sensors)

### Don't Build Until Scale:
- Mobile apps (web app works fine for MVP)
- Complex social features (guilds, messaging)
- Marketplace/economy features
- Advanced analytics/data science

### Never Build:
- Features that dilute the core focus
- Anything users don't explicitly want
- Solutions looking for problems

---

## Philosophy and Principles

### Product Philosophy
- **Focus beats breadth** - Own one thing completely before expanding
- **Execution > ideas** - Implementation quality matters more than feature count
- **Core loop first** - Everything serves the main progression experience
- **Real users > assumptions** - Ship early, measure behavior, iterate

### Development Philosophy
- **Simplicity first** - Choose boring technology that works
- **Ship > perfect** - Done is better than perfect
- **Time-box everything** - Prevent scope creep and perfectionism
- **Delete aggressively** - Remove features that don't drive retention

### Community Philosophy
- **Serve the niche** - Make 1,000 people love it vs. 100,000 people like it
- **Be transparent** - Share the journey, admit limitations
- **Listen to power users** - Behavior > opinions, but engaged users know best
- **Build in public** - Community involvement creates investment

---

## Questions to Answer With Real Users

1. **Does the three-skill system feel right, or do people want more granularity?**
   - Watch for requests for specific muscle group tracking
   - Balance: too many skills dilutes progression feeling

2. **Is the character class meaningful or just flavor?**
   - Currently cosmetic - should it have perks/bonuses?
   - Or is identity alone sufficient?

3. **What's the first drop-off point?**
   - Create account but never log workout?
   - Log once and never return?
   - Engage for 2 weeks then disappear?

4. **What features drive retention vs. what sounds cool?**
   - Social features might be requested but not used
   - Analytics might be used but not requested

5. **What would make someone pay $10/month?**
   - Beyond tracking capability, what's the value?
   - Social visibility? UI beauty? Automated tracking?

## Closing Thoughts

This is a strong idea with clear product-market fit potential. The thesis (MMO grinders overlap with weightlifters) is specific and testable. The prototype already exists and works. The tools to ship quickly are available.

The only way to fail is to not ship.

Focus on:
1. Getting it live with basic functionality
2. Making it look game-like enough to match the concept
3. Putting it in front of 100 real users
4. Listening to what they do, not just what they say

Everything else is details.

The niche is real. The timing is right. The execution is yours.

Now go make some MMO grinders stronger.
